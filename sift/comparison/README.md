# Purpose of this Directory

This is a stub directory for modules which should contain a function called "compare" that takes two file-like objects and generates a numeric score to be stored 

e.g.

compare(file_a, file_b):
    string_a = file_a.read()
    string_b = file_b.read()
    output = perform_computation(string_a, string_b)
    return output
